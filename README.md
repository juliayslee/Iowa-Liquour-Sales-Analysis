# Iowa-Liquour-Sales-Analysis

I have taken this huge data base from [Iowa's liquor sales](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) which "contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees by product and date of purchase from January 1, 2012. The dataset can be used to analyze total spirits sales in Iowa of individual products at the store level." Using Postgresql I have analyzed the data by table to answer questions and help make insightful conclusions.
